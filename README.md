# McMaster Unity Developers!

As the leader of the team, I guided the development of a game using Unity, utilizing your skills in project management to ensure that deadlines were met and that all members were working effectively together. I implemented a system of procedural generation within the game, allowing for a unique and dynamic player experience. Through effective communication and delegation, I was able to lead my team to success in creating a fun and engaging game that utilizes the power of procedural generation.
